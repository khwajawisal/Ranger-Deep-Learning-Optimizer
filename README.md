# Ranger-Deep-Learning-Optimizer
Ranger - a synergistic optimizer combining RAdam (Rectified Adam) and LookAhead in one codebase.
(I built on LonePatient's implementation for the Lookahead part, and the official RAdam code for RAdam, I had to fork the Repo and uld it from source i am using different optimizers as part of ongoin research in Computer vision and trying to break some records).

Usage and notebook to test with comming shortly.
